# ðŸ“š AI Book Generator

## Overview
The **AI Book Generator** is a Streamlit-based application that helps authors create structured books using AI. The user provides a title and a description of the book, and the AI generates a Table of Contents (TOC). Once the TOC is approved, the AI generates content for each chapter and subtopic in markdown format. The content is then pushed to a GitHub repository using PyGithub.

## Features
- Generate a book's Table of Contents based on user input.
- AI-powered generation of chapter content in markdown format.
- Content approval flow to ensure user satisfaction.
- Automatic publishing to a GitHub repository using PyGithub.
- Uses LangGraph for managing multi-step conversational flows.
- Attractive user interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
